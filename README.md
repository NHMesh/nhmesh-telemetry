#### Description

The Producer container connects to a Meshtastic node via its HTTP API and forwards packets from the mesh network to an MQTT broker. This allows for remote monitoring and processing of Meshtastic network traffic.

The producer requires:
1. A running Meshtastic node with HTTP API enabled
2. An MQTT broker that it can connect to with the provided credentials

##### Traceroute Logic and Backoff Strategy

The telemetry producer implements an intelligent traceroute system that automatically discovers network topology while being respectful of network resources through exponential backoff and retry limiting.

The traceroute functionality serves two main purposes:
1. **Network Discovery**: Automatically traceroute newly discovered nodes to map network topology
2. **Topology Monitoring**: Periodically re-traceroute known nodes to detect topology changes

###### Key Features

- **Automatic Discovery**: New nodes are automatically queued for traceroute
- **Periodic Re-scanning**: Known nodes are re-tracerouted at configurable intervals (default: 3 hours)
- **Exponential Backoff**: Failed traceroutes trigger increasingly longer delays before retry
- **Retry Limiting**: Nodes that consistently fail are eventually abandoned
- **Persistent State**: Retry counts and backoff timers survive container restarts
- **Global Cooldown**: Prevents overwhelming the network with too many simultaneous traceroutes

###### Backoff Strategy

With default settings (3-hour interval, 5 max retries, 24-hour max backoff):

| Failure Count | Backoff Time | Description |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | 0 seconds | First failure - immediate retry allowed |
| 2 | 3 hours | Base interval |
| 3 | 6 hours | 2× base interval |
| 4 | 12 hours | 4× base interval |
| 5+ | 24 hours | Capped at maximum |

###### State Persistence

The system maintains persistent state across restarts by saving:
- Last traceroute time for each node
- Failure counts for each node  
- Backoff timers for failed nodes
- Automatic cleanup of expired backoff states on startup

This ensures that container restarts don't reset the backoff logic, preventing immediate re-flooding of the network with traceroutes to previously failing nodes

### nhmesh/telemetry-collector

A Docker container that subscribes to MQTT topics with Meshtastic data and stores it into Elasticsearch.

#### Usage

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name telemetry-collector \
  -e MQTT_ENDPOINT=mqtt.nhmesh.live \
  -e MQTT_USERNAME=your_username \
  -e MQTT_PASSWORD=your_password \
  -e ES_ENDPOINT=your_elasticsearch_endpoint \
  -e ES_USERNAME=telemetry_writer \
  -e ES_PASSWORD=your_es_password \
  ghcr.io/nhmesh/telemetry-collector:latest
```

#### Description

The Collector container subscribes to MQTT topics that contain Meshtastic packet data, processes these packets, and stores them into Elasticsearch for further analysis and visualization.

The collector requires:
1. An MQTT broker with Meshtastic data (usually published by the producer container)
2. An Elasticsearch instance for storing the processed data

## Development

 - Install Python
 - Install Poetry

```
poetry install

poetry run nhmesh-telemetry/producer.py
poetry run nhmesh-telemetry/collector.py
```

## Docker Setup

 1. In the docker folder... copy the sample.env to telemetry.env and tweak values
 2. `docker compose up -d`

 ```
 docker compose logs
 ```
